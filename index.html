          <p class="lead">
Consider the challenge Utilities have as they consider, deploy and operationalize the Smart Grid. Before they had 2-way communications for meters (what is referred to as Automated Metering Infrastructure or AMI) utilities collected meter usage monthly by sending a person to the house to physically read the dial or LCD display of the meter. Notwithstanding the data handling errors. this required massive amount of man power. For a utility with 4MM customers, this produced 4MM records every month. However with AMI utilities can gather meter readings anytime remotely, at up to 5min intervals, without the need for a workforce.  In the case of one utility with 4MM customers – they decided to collect 25 samples a day – one per hour and one daily. This increased their monthly records from 4MM to three BILLION - a whopping 750% increase in the amount of data that needs to be processes and collected per month! Besides the massive amount of data growth, the new velocity of this data means that Utilities have an understanding. And this is just the beginning – as more utility devices are deployed with 2-way communication as part of larger Smart Grid initiatives – think smart capacitor banks, switches, and transformers – the volume and velocity of data increases.
<br> <br>
The question then becomes how utilities can use all this fast and massive data – along with other data they have or can get - to create new products or services and drive greater efficiencies.

</p><ul class="lead">

<li> Time Of Use (TOU) or Critical peak pricing (CPP) programs by analyzing usage trends along with power production and delivery data</li>  
</ul>
<p class="lead">2 technology areas:</p> 
<ul class="lead">
<li>Predictive analytics require near real-time ingest and processing to get to decisions faster  - Current ingest technologies and single vertical stack deployments – common of traditional ETL/DW  – fall apart or are too costly at these speeds</li>
<li>Data with so much volume, variety, and velocity along with the geospatial characteristics (service routes, roads, neighborhood, community, city, state, etc) important to a utility require new visualization techniques beyond traditional BI tools</li>

          <p class="lead">
In the healthcare space, IoT and sensor data will become a huge part of the industry moving forward. Within the next two years, it is presumed there will be close to 100 million wearable health devices. For now these devices are primarily used for personal use. Fitness trackers like FitBit or Nike+ are some key examples.  As the technology continues to improve and the demand increase, in the very near future these devices will be used for much more than tracking distance, heart rate, calories, and steps.
<br> <br> idea might be a miniature device that could be implanted or built into a patch on the skin to monitor a diabetic patient. Data such as blood sugar, body temp, and a variety of other sources mixed with the already possible heart rate and activity, could trigger an insulin pump to adjust the administered dosage. In addition the data could be fed back to a the patient’s physician for tracking and follow up. Another example might be a wearable monitor or imbedded device that can track heart rate, looking for any irregularities. Alerts could be sent to a doctor or hospital, as well as the patient’s mobile device or a wearable alarm. A call could be placed, from the hospital or doctor to the patient, to check on their status, and also have them seek follow up care. Or in extreme scenarios, an ambulance could be dispatched immediately to the location of the patient using GPS and location services data. By taking this proactive approach to monitoring, not only will it be possible to save more lives or respond in a more timely fashion, but also reduce cost by reducing readmissions and treating conditions before they become extreme. Hospital equipment could also be linked together using IoT and Sensors. There are numerous possibilities for this technology, such as tracking supply levels for auto restock, preventative maintenance for faulty or failing parts and pieces, as well as automated integration into EMR and PHI systems. The automated integration could save man hours on manual entry of data as well as help avoid costly typos.
<br> <br>A growing area of interest within Healthcare and IoT, is population health and the data associated with it. Wide ranges of environmental and behavioral factors, such as living in a polluted city, heavy traffic, or smoking can drastically impact a patient’s health. Public data that can be mined and collected on these type factors through activity on social media sites or restaurant and dining habits, as well as data such as shopping or travel patterns can be blended with a patient’s healthcare data for improved diagnosis and care.

<!-- Manufacturing Stories -->

        <div><a name="ManufacturingStory1"></a>
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Manufacturing – Mechanical Engineering Story<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
          <p class="lead">
When manufacturing mechanical devices (also applies to many other types of manufacturing but not all) different types of lathes and mills preform most of the work.  The idea is you take a block of material and machine out a piece or part.  This piece or part could be the end product or it could be one piece in a larger assembly.  For the sake of the example let’s just call them widgets.
<br><br>
Today, most widget manufacturing starts off with designing the widget in a 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) software.  Once the design is complete the model is digested by Numerical Control (NC) Programing software that generate a machine program that can be fed to one or many machines to make the widget.  For every dimension that is specified there is a nominal value and range of acceptable values.  For example, the part may need to be 10” in diameter.  To make every single part exactly 10” is almost impossible depending on how accurately you measure the part.  The print may say make the part 9.9 to 10.1 inches.  In jet engine manufacturing for example they may measure the size of part out to 4, 5 or even 6 decimals (or 50 millionths of an inch).  Some argue if this is even possible because you can breathe on something and it will change size more than that do the temperature of your breath (but that’s another story). 
 <br><br>
These measurement are typically done with very accurate measurement machines called Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMM’s).  This is typically done in tightly controlled temperature and humidity rooms and only after parts have normalized to the same as the CMM’s.
 <br><br>
All these machines, lathes, mills, cmm’s, etc. collect and can provide massive amounts of data.  This data can be used to make better parts, less scrap, larger batches and ultimately drive down the cost of the part, decrease production times and drive higher profits.
 <br><br>
Here is how.
<br><br> 
By collecting the data from the CMM’s we now know how close to nominal (perfect) the measurement was on the part we just made.  The lathes and mills have a value called an offset.  You can preset and adjust to correct for slight variations.  For example, let’s say our 10” part comes off at 10.1”.  Let’s change the offset on the machine from 0 to -0.1”.  The next part that comes off the line should then be 10” exactly.  Now, this is a gross over simplification of actually how it’s done and calculated but you get the point.
 <br><br>
Now imagine a manufacturing line where robotic arms are transferring the part from one station to another and even running the measurements.  As we measure parts coming off the line we do analytics on the data (measurements) and can truly understand where the parts are headed in size, if a bad widget is a one off, and correct sizing before getting out of tolerance conditions.  On demand we’ll calculate correct offsets and continually adjust to making parts to nominal.
